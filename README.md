# FDK MQA Url Checker

This service is a component of the Metadata Quality Assessment (MQA) stack. It listens to dataset harvested events from
Kafka and checks every accessUrl and downloadUrl (http status 2xx) for all distributions in a dataset. The results of these checks are
stored in a Data Quality Vocabulary (DQV) metrics model and published to the MQA event topic in Kafka for further
processing.

For a broader understanding of the systemâ€™s context, refer to the [architecture documentation](https://github.com/Informasjonsforvaltning/architecture-documentation) wiki. For more specific
context on this application, see the [Metadata Quality](https://github.com/Informasjonsforvaltning/architecture-documentation/wiki/Architecture-documentation#-metadata-quality) subsystem section.
